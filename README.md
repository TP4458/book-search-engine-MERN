# MERN Stack - Book Search Engine

## Description

In this project I used provided starter code for a Google Books API search engine that was set-up using RESTful API, and I've rebuild it to use Apollo server and GraphQL API instead.

This application is build using React front, MongoDB, Node/Express server and APIs. It provides the user with functionality to create a new accoun, search for books, and to save/remove books to their account.

In my task of refactoring the code I did the following:

- Setup the Appollo server, built GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.
- Setup Apollo provider to communicate requests with the server.
- Refactored authentication middleware to work with GraphQL.

The application is deployed to Heroku and uses MongoDB Atlas.
